Why is it that we address other crisis with cultural shift that results in policies that address the issue head. Why do people value inanimate objects over the lives of their fellow citizens.

<h1 style= "text-align: center" >History of Guns In america</h1>
<div class="paraeven">To understand why we have a gun epedemic in a highly delpoled country we must go back to phelpedpia in 1789 when the Coisntiution was founded. The foudning fathers just won a violent revolution angaist a tyranical governemt and were afraid of a strong central governemt. They wanted the power to be decentralized through a process called federalism with main checks on the governemnt. One check agaisnt a governemt going to tyranical was giving citizens the opportunuty to possses weopns for service in State Militias. This princienple was encrsiend into the Constutuion through the 2nd Ademndent to the bill of rights.<i>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.</i> This admendent for most of hsitory meant that indivuduals had the right to own fireamrs only for the use in a state milita until a 2008 Supreme Court hearing DC v Hellar encrined the radical princeiple of a indivudals right to bear arms for sell defenese..<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/District-of-Columbia-v-Heller">Link to Source</a> </div>
